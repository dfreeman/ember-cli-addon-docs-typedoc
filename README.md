ember-cli-addon-docs-typedoc
==============================================================================

This is an experimental package integrating [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) with [AddonDocs](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-cli-addon-docs). While an interesting experiment, I think there are likely to be better options for TypeScript + AddonDocs in the long run.

You're welcome to try this package out, but caveat emptor: I can't make any promises that it will meet your needs, and it's thoroughly undocumented and has no automated testing.

## Compatibility

* Ember.js v4.8 or above
* Ember CLI v4.8 or above
* Node.js v18 or above


## Installation

```
yarn add --dev ember-cli-addon-docs-typedoc
```
